# Better Balanced Shields

Mod made for my own use -- do not expect updates or downgrades unless I want
updates or downgrades! -- which makes shields:

- Deflect arrows, splash potions (buff and debuff) (configurable)
- Only absorb 50% of melee damage (configurable)
- Deflect 0% of melee damage (configurable)
- Ignore lingering potion effect (inc. dragon breath) while shield is up (configurable)
- (configurable)

And again, NO, I will not be porting it to any version or mod loader unless I
want to!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you make an issue or comment asking for this ANYWAY,
expect nothing more than a single emoji and your issue closed without resolution!!!!
Also check the license!!! You can just fork the project and make your own port if you
want it so bad!!!!

Bye!!!
